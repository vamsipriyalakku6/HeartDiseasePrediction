# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📑 Overview
This project focuses on predicting the presence of **heart disease** in patients using various **Machine Learning algorithms**. The dataset includes medical attributes such as age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, etc. This prediction system helps in early diagnosis, aiding healthcare professionals in decision-making.

## 🚀 Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing
- Multiple machine learning models for prediction
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Deployment-ready structure

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (3.8+)
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Streamlit** / **Flask** (optional for deployment)

## 📊 Metrics Used
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision / Recall / F1-score**
## 📂 Dataset
